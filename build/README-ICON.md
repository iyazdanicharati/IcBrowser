# Icon Setup Instructions

To add a custom icon for your browser:

1. Create or obtain an `.ico` file (Windows icon format)
   - Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 pixels
   - You can use online tools like:
     - https://convertio.co/png-ico/
     - https://www.icoconverter.com/

2. Save the icon file as `build/icon.ico`

3. The icon will be automatically used when building the executable

## Quick Icon Creation

If you don't have an icon yet, you can:
- Use a PNG image and convert it to ICO format
- Use an icon generator tool
- Create a simple icon using image editing software

The icon file should be named exactly `icon.ico` and placed in the `build/` directory.
